## 🎉 Final Recommendation

For **Compass-io CLI**, I recommend the **MIT License** because:

1. **Maximizes adoption**: Encourages widespread use and contribution
2. **Aligns with ethical goals**: Allows anyone to use the tool for ethical decision-making
3. **Simple and clear**: Easy for users to understand and comply with
4. **Encourages innovation**: Permits commercial and non-commercial use
5. **Community-friendly**: Well-understood and widely accepted

However, if you want to ensure that modifications remain open-source and contribute back to the ethical ecosystem, **GNU GPL v3** might be a better choice.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the license options
2. Make a decision based on your goals
3. Create the LICENSE file
4. Update all documentation
5. Communicate the license to users

The choice is yours - all options are good for open-source! 🚀

# Compass-io CLI

> WIP - Work In Progress. 
> This project is in it's early stages. If you want to know more about it, please visit Compass-io API first (attention: code meets poetry. you have been warned.)

Compass-io is a configurable ethical framework for decision-making in software, allowing different models of reasoning — care, consequence, dignity, ecology — to be expressed, compared, and shared.

## Overview


### 🔍 Features (planned)

A CLI version featuring some core functionality

- Model multiple ethical systems (utilitarian, care ethics, bio-inclusive, etc.)
- Allow users to assign ethical weightings and red lines
- Compare decision outcomes across chosen value models
- Encourage transparent, values-driven development

| **Lenses**                     | Modifiers like `sparks`, `fragility`, or `deepTime` that adjust model behavior                  |
| **Red Flag Detection**         | Critical alerts for nuclear war, torture, extinction, etc.                                      |
| **Ethical Comparison**         | Show outputs across multiple models to reveal tension or harmony                                |
| **Stakeholder Consultation**   | Evaluate outcomes from the view of those impacted, including future beings or symbolic entities |
